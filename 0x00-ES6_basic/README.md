#ES6 Basic JavaScript Exercises

##This repository contains a series of JavaScript exercises focused on mastering ES6 (ECMAScript 2015) syntax and features. The exercises cover various concepts including constants, block-scoping, arrow functions, default parameters, spread/rest operators, string interpolation, and more. Each file is an exercise that builds upon the previous one, with the goal of solidifying your understanding of modern JavaScript.

##0Files

0-constants.js
Objective: Demonstrates the use of const to declare constants in JavaScript.
Execution: This script shows how constants are used to store values that do not change and are block-scoped.
1-block-scoped.js
Objective: Explores block-scoping using let and const in JavaScript.
Execution: Illustrates how variables declared with let and const are limited in scope to the block in which they are defined.
2-arrow.js
Objective: Introduces arrow functions (=>) in JavaScript.
Execution: Shows how arrow functions can be used to write concise function expressions.
3-default-parameter.js
Objective: Demonstrates the use of default parameters in functions.
Execution: Shows how default values can be provided for function parameters if no argument is passed.
4-rest-parameter.js
Objective: Explores the use of the rest parameter (...) in functions.
Execution: Shows how a function can accept an indefinite number of arguments as an array.
5-spread-operator.js
Objective: Demonstrates the spread operator (...) in JavaScript.
Execution: Shows how the spread operator can be used to expand an array into individual elements.
6-string-interpolation.js
Objective: Explores template literals for string interpolation.
Execution: Shows how to embed expressions inside string literals using the ${} syntax.
7-getBudgetObject.js
Objective: Introduces object creation using computed property names.
Execution: Shows how to create an object with dynamic keys using ES6 syntax.
8-getBudgetCurrentYear.js
Objective: Demonstrates how to use computed property names with dynamic values.
Execution: Creates an object where keys are dynamically generated based on the current year.
9-getFullBudget.js
Objective: Demonstrates object manipulation by combining multiple objects.
Execution: Shows how to create an object that combines different budgets into one.
10-loops.js
Objective: Introduces the for...of loop in JavaScript.
Execution: Replaces traditional loops with the for...of loop to iterate over array elements.
11-createEmployeesObject.js
Objective: Demonstrates object creation using ES6 features.
Execution: Shows how to create an object with department names as keys and employee lists as values.
12-createReportObject.js
Objective: Explores creating complex objects and adding methods to objects.
Execution: Creates a report object that contains all employees and includes a method to count the number of departments.
100-createIteratorObject.js
Objective: Introduces iterators in JavaScript.
Execution: Creates an iterator for an object that allows iterating through all employees across different departments.
101-iterateThroughObject.js
Objective: Demonstrates how to iterate through an object using an iterator.
Execution: Combines all employee names from an object into a single string, separated by a delimiter.
